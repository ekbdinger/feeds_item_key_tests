Did some testing with feeds this morning. I’m going to turn the content type I created into a feature.

Trying to think if there is any other configuration that I can put into a feature.

Let’s see.

So I created 2 content types

	--Item Key spreadsheet (this is the most detailed one, 6 fields from the spreadsheet
	--Item Key Import is the simple one that is simply just a title and body


The feed importers I created are called
	--Item Key Spread take2  (item key spreadsheet)
	--Item key import  (item key import)


I also just created 2 content types to attach the node importers too

	--Feed (Item Key Import)
	--Feed Item Key (Item Key spreadsheet)


Feature Name = item key spreadsheet

2nd feature name = IK Simple import

Ok, so created the two features nice.

Let’s put them into version control and github
